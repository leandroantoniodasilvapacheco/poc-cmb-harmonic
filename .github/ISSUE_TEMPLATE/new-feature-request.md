## Is Your Feature Request Related to a Problem?
Describe the problem (e.g., pipeline lacks analysis for Phase II Cold Spot l=209° b=-57°).

## Describe the Solution
Proposed solution (e.g., add hp.query_disc raio 5° or CAMB mod V(φ)=(1/2)m²φ²+(λ/Φ)φ⁴).

## Alternatives Considered
Any alternative approaches?

## Additional Context
How does this align with POC goals? (e.g., test H1 α≈0.618 p<0.01 KS).
